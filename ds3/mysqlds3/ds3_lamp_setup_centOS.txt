Install git

Clone DS3 from github
	mkdir ds3
	git clone https://github.com/dvdstore/ds3.git

Download MySQL Installer RPM to /install/mysql/
	Downloaded from http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/repo/
	This RPM will setup the repository for mysql
	yum localinstall mysql57-community-release-el7-11.noarch.rpm
Install latest version of MySQL:
	yum install mysql-server
	Installs version 5.7.19-1.el7 (as of this writing on 9/5/2017)
Install apache2 and php with mysql support
	yum install httpd httpd-devel (Installs httpd-2.4.6-45)
	yum install php php-mysql
Start MySQL
	service mysqld start
Add web user and set its password to web
     useradd web
     passwd web
     chmod 755 /home/web
Install DVD Store
	cd /root/ds3/
	perl Install_DVDStore.pl
	Answer questions - 5, GB, MYSQL, LINUX
MySQL
	Open mysql interactive prompt:
	mysql
	
If you get an error that root does not have permission to logon do the following to reset root password:
	service mysqld stop
	cd /var/lib/mysql
	chown mysql.mysql *
	mysqld --user=root --skip-grant-tables
In another session:
	mysql
	FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
	ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'Ca$hc0w1';
	exit
	ps -A |grep mysql
	kill <PID of mysql process>
	service mysqld start

Create needed mysql users in a mysql session:
	mysql
	disable the password vaidation rules so that our short password will be accepted:
		uninstall plugin validate_password;
	create user web with a password of web:
		create user 'web'@'localhost' identified by 'web';
		grant ALL PRIVILEGES on *.* to 'web'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'web';
		exit;
	If you are going to have a web server on another host or run the mysql direct DB driver from another host
		then you will need to add a web user for that host:
		create user 'web'@'clienthost.com' identified by 'web';
		grant ALL PRIVILEGES on *.* to 'web'@'clienthost.com' IDENTIFIED BY 'web';

Create DS3 and load data:
     cd /root/ds3/mysqlds3
     sh mysqlds3_create_all.sh

Setup Webtier
     mkdir /var/www/html/ds3
     cp /root/home/ds3/mysqlds3/web/php5/* /var/www/html/ds3
Edit /etc/php.ini file so that the default mysql user is web/web:
	mysql.default_user = web
	mysql.default_password = web

	systemctl restart httpd
	
Use web browser to test out web interface at http://<lampstackhostname>/ds3/

Login to the DS3 application with user1/password.

In the initial version of DVD Store 3 .net framework 4.5 and MySQL .Net Connector version 6.9.6 was used.  If you have a different version of either .net or the
MySQL .Net Connector it might be necessary to recompile the driver program before it will run.

It is a fairly simple (not too difficult) command line based compile.  In the ds3xdrvier.cs file header the compile instructions are included and also covered here as well in a little more detail.

Download the ds3 files from github on to the windows client system with .Net installed.

Download the MySQL .Net Connector from the dev.mysql.com website - http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net/

Run the .net connector installer - mysql-connector-net-6.9.6.msi -> Next, Typical, Install, Finish.
This will install the MySQL.Data.dll that is needed for the driver program to execute.

If your version of the .net connector is different than above, you will need to recompile the driver program as below.

Recompile the driver program to use the new MySQL.Data.dll that comes with the current version of the connector:

C:\ds3\drivers>c:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\csc.exe /out:ds3mysqldriverNew.exe ds3xdriver.cs c:\ds3\mysqlds3\ds3mysqlfns.cs /d:USE_WIN32_TIMER /d:GEN_PERF_CTRS /r:"c:\Program Files (x86)\MySQL\MySQL Connector Net 6.9.6\Assemblies\v4.0\MySql.Data.dll"

To make the command much shorter, you can add the csc.exe into the PATH environment variable, and have the two source .cs files copied into the same directory.
